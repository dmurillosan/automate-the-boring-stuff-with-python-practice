# Automate the Boring Stuff - Practice Projects

![Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](./automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_cover.jpg)

Personal Python projects built while working through *Automate The Boring Stuff With Python* to practice core concepts and develop familiarity with the language.

## About This Repo

As I work through the book, I identify actual workflow inefficiencies or repetitive tasks in my daily routine, then build Python tools to solve them. Each project practices multiple concepts across different chapters.

## Projects

### [Password Generator](./Password%20Generator/)
**Concepts Practiced:** `argparse`, `secrets`, `string` module, input validation, cryptographic security

Command-line utility that generates cryptographically secure passwords following CISA security best practices. Supports customizable length (8-512 characters) with enforced character diversity. Built to create strong master passwords for password managers like Vaultwarden.

### [Stopwatch](./Stopwatch/)

**Concepts Practiced:** `datetime`, file I/O, loops, state management, exception handling

Command-line timer for tracking focused work sessions without switching devices. Logs all timer events to a file and displays elapsed time in HH:MM:SS format.

## Learning Approach

1. Read chapters and understand the concepts
2. Identify a real problem in my workflow
3. Design and build a solution from scratch
4. Document what I learned and what could be improved
